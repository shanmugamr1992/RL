# 1. Establish which NeMo-RL is under test.
#
#    Two modes. With NEMO_RL_FETCH_REF set, take the named revision's SOURCE so
#    the run is reproducible from a sha and picks up fixes that are raised but
#    not yet merged. Without it, overlay the synced worktree, which is how a
#    candidate fix gets exercised before it is pushed.
#
#    Source only -- deliberately not `git reset --hard`. The image's Ray worker
#    venvs under /opt/ray_venvs were resolved from the image's `uv.lock`, and
#    swapping in another revision's lock file makes uv rebuild them against
#    different pins than the driver venv still has. That is not theoretical: the
#    first attempt did exactly this and every test died in 29 seconds on
#    `AttributeError: Can't get attribute '_get_opentelemetry' on
#    ray.util.tracing.tracing_helper`, a driver/worker Ray mismatch that looks
#    nothing like its cause. Dependency metadata therefore stays at the image's
#    revision; only the Python sources and test scripts move.
#
#    This has to happen BEFORE the Bridge and mcore checkouts: Bridge lives under
#    CONTAINER_ROOT/3rdparty, and touching NeMo-RL afterwards risks their pins.
#    Outermost repo first, innermost last.
